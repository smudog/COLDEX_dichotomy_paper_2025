# Scripts supporting "Dome A basal ice truncated at an extensive geologic dichotomy in the South Pole Basin of East Antarctica"

## Introduction
These scripts are intented to support a paper on airborne results over the South Pole Basin conducted by the National Science Foundations Center for Oldest Ice Exploration (NSF COLDEX).

Requirements are:
* A UNIX style environment
* python 3.12
* GMT >6.5
* Scipts being in a path with `code` as a directory
* Downloaded datasets being in a parallel path with `orig` as a directory
* Processed data and figures being in a parallel path with `targ` as a directory

Installed pip packages include:
numpy | pandas | rioxarray | xarray | pygmt | PIL | h5py | pyproj | netCDF4

## Datasets to download to orig
Relevent **ice thickness** datasets from [Open Polar Radar](https://www.openpolarradar.org) and [Bedmap](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/bedmap/) can be automatically downloaded using the script `get_data.sh`.  
A relevent dataset for Titan Dome, [Beem et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.15784/601437) required passing a Capcha.

Other relevent datasets to download:
* **Basal Ice Layer Thickness:** Yan, Shuia, Alejandra Vega Gonz√†lez, Shivangini Singh, Megan Kerr and Duncan Young: TBD at USAP-DC (includes a file defining the dichotomy)
* **Basal Specularity Data:** Young, Duncan; Kerr, Megan E.; Singh, Shivangini; Yan, Shuai; Kempf, Scott D; Buhl, Dillon P; Ng, Gregory; Blankenship, Donald D., 2025, "NSF COLDEX 2023-24 Level 2 Basal Specularity Content Profiles", https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/KHUT1U, Texas Data Repository, V1; Young, Duncan; Kerr, Megan E.; Singh, Shivangini; Yan, Shuai; Kempf, Scott D; Buhl, Dillon P; Ng, Gregory; Blankenship, Donald D., 2025, "NSF COLDEX 2022-23 Level 2 Basal Specularity Content Profiles", https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/6T5JS6, Texas Data Repository, V1

## Scripts under `submission`
* `read_h5.py` reads the MEaSUREs ice velocity data an converts it into GIS friendly GeoTiffs
* `process_data.py` generates GeoTiffs for bed elevation, ice thickness, specularity content, basal ice thickness, [roughness](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2000JE001429) as well as profiles of high pass bed elevation.
* `make_context_map.py` generates Figure 1 and requires the projected radargrams.
* `make_coldex_cuestas.py` generates Figure 3, and requires the projected radargrams, the Sanderson et al. englacial isochrons, and the delay doppler product.  This script generates files that are required for Figures 2 and Figure S2.
* `make_coldex_overview_maps.sh` generates Figure S2 and Figure 2.  These figures requires the gridded COLDEX products, the projected radargrams (ie the associated metadata), the velocity grids, and the high pass bed product.

* Additional scipts under `map` provide additional supplemental figures, but have not be adapted to run outside the UTIG environment.
